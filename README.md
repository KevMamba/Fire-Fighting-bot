The fire fighting robot built on an Arduino IDE senses fires in its vicinity using the flame sensor. 
Upon which, the LED turns on and the buzzer starts buzzing thereby alerting people. 
Water stored in a tank is pumped out using a 5V water pump and is made to spread out with the help of a servo motor which helps covers a larger area.
